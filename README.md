MyKeys
======
A [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org/) plugin that defines custom keyboard shortcuts.

I use it together with my [OpenInBgTab](https://github.com/dandersson/ttrss-openinbgtab) plugin that enables hotkey functionality for opening articles in background tabs.

The idea of these hotkeys is to have all functions concentrated around the arrow keys. I find it real nice — add your own touch.

Requirements
------------
TT-RSS ≥1.7.6 for OpenInBgTab functionality. TT-RSS ≥1.7.5 for the `*` syntax for the `Shift` modifier key.

For TT-RSS ≤1.7.8 — use version 1.0 of this plugin. The plugin API changed for TT-RSS 1.7.9, and 1.1 is an update to reflect this.

Upstream
--------
The project lives at <https://github.com/dandersson/ttrss-mykeys>.
